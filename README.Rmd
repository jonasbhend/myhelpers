# R package `myhelpers`
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonasbhend/myhelpers.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonasbhend/myhelpers)

This package consists of a lose collection of functions to simplify data analysis and plotting. Most of the functions will be fairly specific to the currently used compute environment and thus probably not of greater use to the general public.
