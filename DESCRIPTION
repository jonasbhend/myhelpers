Description: A lose collection of functions to simplify data analyses and
    plotting. Most of the functions will be fairly specific to the currently
    used compute environment and thus probably not of greater use to the
    general public.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0),
    ncdf4,
    reshape2,
    maps,
    lubridate
Imports:
    colorspace,
    geocors
